# OSU_2022_Spring_Data_Viz
This is a collection of visualizations that I coded and collaborated on for OSU's ST 537 Data Visualization Class

In Alternate and Replicate Plots, my group and I replicated or created alternative plots of visualizations such as the increasing trends of California wildfires or of flight delays.

In Assignments, there are 2 main personal projects that I worked on:

1. Visualizing film data from 1950's to 2000s. There were 3 questions that I wanted to ask:
 a. How has the raiting of films for genres changed over the decades?
 b. How does budget affect length of movies? 
 c. What's been the most popular type of movies?
 
2. Visualizing pokemon stat trends up to Generation 6. The Shiny app can be accessed at the following link: https://amyly2145.shinyapps.io/poke_trends/

In Data Manipulation Exercises, I practiced manipulating and tidying data with several ggplot functions and performed exploratory data analysis with airbag accident data. 

In Group Discussions, my groupmates and I summarized data visualization techniques or talked about what made good and bad graphics.
